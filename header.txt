🏥 Prompt Header — FacturaCore ERP (Rytis Workspace)

Context Summary:
You (Rytis) are developing FacturaCore, a modular, Sylius/Symfony-based multi-tenant ERP platform for dental clinics.
It’s structured around independent PHP packages (“cores”) and designed for scalable, package-oriented architecture similar to Sylius components.
The project is active locally at /Users/Ryttis/code/php/facturacore.

🧩 Main Packages (Modules)
Module	Purpose
PatientCore	Patients, visits, anamnesis, teeth chart, medical history
TempoCore	Appointments, availability, scheduling
PaymentCore	Invoices, payments, receipts (no full bookkeeping)
IntegrationCore	Integration with eSveikata (Lithuania’s e-health system)
(Later) AnalyticsCore	Reporting and data visualization for clinic KPIs

🎯 Current Focus (Next Work Cycle)

✅ MCP file reading tested (readFacturaFile)
